# Security Considerations

## Known Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities have been identified in the project's dependencies:

1. **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check** (GHSA-rp65-9cf3-cjxr)
   - Severity: High
   - Affected package: nth-check < 2.0.1
   - Path: react-scripts > @svgr/webpack > @svgr/plugin-svgo > svgo > css-select > nth-check

2. **PostCSS line return parsing error** (GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j)
   - Severity: Moderate
   - Affected package: postcss < 8.4.31
   - Path: react-scripts > resolve-url-loader > postcss

## Mitigation Strategy

These vulnerabilities are in deep dependencies of react-scripts, and fixing them would require downgrading react-scripts from version 5.0.1 to 3.0.1, which would be a breaking change. After careful consideration, we have decided to accept these vulnerabilities for the following reasons:

1. **Impact Assessment**: 
   - The vulnerabilities are in packages used during the build process, not in runtime code.
   - The nth-check vulnerability relates to regular expression complexity, which could potentially lead to denial of service in specific circumstances.
   - The postcss vulnerability relates to line return parsing, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in specific circumstances.

2. **Risk Acceptance**:
   - The risk is limited to the development and build environment.
   - These vulnerabilities do not affect the runtime security of the application.
   - The application does not process untrusted SVG files or CSS, which would be the attack vectors for these vulnerabilities.

3. **Future Mitigation**:
   - We will monitor for updates to react-scripts that address these vulnerabilities.
   - When a new version of react-scripts is released that fixes these issues without breaking changes, we will update immediately.

## Regular Security Audits

We are committed to maintaining the security of our application. We will:

1. Regularly run `npm audit` to identify new vulnerabilities.
2. Update dependencies to fix vulnerabilities whenever possible.
3. Document and assess any vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately fixed.
4. Review this security policy regularly to ensure it remains effective.
